Comment: These time series are inhomogeneous because of station relocations and changes in observation techniques. As a result, these series are not suitable for trend analysis. For climate change studies we refer to the homogenized series of daily data <http://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/klimatologie/daggegevens> or the Central Netherlands Temperature <http://www.knmi.nl/kennis-en-datacentrum/achtergrond/centraal-nederland-temperatuur-cnt>.
